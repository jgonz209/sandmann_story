In a small biergarten in Raesfeld, they sell a type of magical bratwurst. 
Nearby someone was blasting Rammstein while choking on gebaecks.
Gebaecks are not my favorite so I instead decided to grab a bratwurst.
After eating the magical bratwurst we decided to do some shopping on the Hauptstrasse in Raesfeld.
It was a nice Summer day, so they were wearing their best lederhose.
While out walking past the baeckereis and ratskellers I came upon a large black hund.
This hund was very talented because he was driving a BMW straight to a biergarten.
As he pulled up I could hear loud musik coming from his car stereo.
Upon arriving the biergarten, they found a baeckerei right by it and their gebaek smelled really good, so they decided to go the baeckerei instead.
The baeckerei had many sweets, such as candied Lederhose.
At age 6 I was born without a face.
